# Use Cases

Concrete situations Resource operations should serve. Add yours by pull request: describe who the client and server are, what they need to do, and what they do today instead.

## Shared state written by several agents

The charter names multi-agent and job orchestration systems as the motivating consumers of a shared write path. Several agents, or several runs of one agent, read and update the same Resources (plans, notes, task state). Each needs to know whether its write applied cleanly or raced another one.

## Memory servers

A memory server stores facts as files that an agent reads and rewrites. Today a write is a tool call that replaces the file, so two sessions updating the same memory lose one update without either noticing. A conditional write (update only if the version is still the one I read) and create-if-absent would make that safe, and `notifications/resources/updated` would tell other sessions to re-read.

## Servers that ask for base64 content in prose

Some servers ask the model to pass file content as base64 inside a tool argument, described in the tool's text. The charter calls for a migration guide away from this pattern, which depends on a real write path existing first.

## Navigating large Resource trees

A client working in a large repository or document store needs to list one directory, glob for matching paths, or read metadata (`stat`) without reading every Resource, then read only what it needs.
